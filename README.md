# feed-me-app
An app that allows you to see and show local food available in your area that meets a range of dietary requirements. 
The goal is to connect providers of food with people looking to purchase food, through a card system where users are able to upload the content they are providing and have other users browse these options. This allows for non-permanent food outlets, ie foodtrucks or market stalls to advertise their products.
